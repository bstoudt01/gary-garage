Console application to learn (by practice, practice, practice) using inherited properties and methods 
from parent classes that are passed down to child classes.

Such as

Parent Class: Vehicle
passing down a property of "paintColor" to each 
Child Class: Car, Boat, Truck, Plane
and each of those can pass that property along as well

If the child class handles a virtual method such as: 
pubic virtual void

using an change method:
public override void

that change would also be passed down to the children of the class that changed the virtual method..
